1. Problem Statement:

   The EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this
   information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and
   IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages (or 'unicast-forward' them to the
   owner of the MAC) and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the
   Address Resolution procedure. This EVPN capability is extremely
   useful in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and Data Centers (DCs) with
   large broadcast domains, where the amount of ARP/ND flooded traffic
   causes issues on routers and CEs. This document describes how the
   EVPN Proxy-ARP/ND function may be implemented to help IXPs and other
   operators deal with the issues derived from Address Resolution in
   large broadcast domains.
